# Example notebooks ðŸ“”

We provide [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) with examples to use the OpenPredict API in this folder.

To try the examples clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/knowledge-collaboratory-api.git
```

Then go to the `examples` folder and open the notebooks with your favorite viewer (Jupyter or VisualStudio Code)

To install the dependencies:

```bash
/path/to/vscode/interpreter/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can also start the notebook with docker (requires docker to be installed):

```bash
docker-compose up
```

> The default password of the notebook started with docker is `password`
